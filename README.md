# tic-tac-toe
It is an offline tic tac toe game wtih pygame.
I try to implement Simple factory design pattern for this program. So it could be easier to create grid, object and something like that. <br />  <br />
There are many different design patterns could be implemented in this program, which in some way can improve code management even though this is a tiny program.
I would recommend college students like me to try different design patterns in their program, which do matter to our future career.  <br />  <br />
So far, it only supports some basic playgames, such as play, quit. In the future, I am going to add setting function, which will support resolution, music volumn and piece shapes.

## To compile this program, there are several enviroment needs to be done
### 1. update your python version to/above 3.10
a. 
    `
        Because in this program, there is a feature only supported by python 3.10+, such as match-case
    `
    <br />
b.
    For Mac:
    `
        brew upgrade python3
    `
    <br />
c.
    For Windows:
    `
        Go to python website install the latest version, then uninstall old version
    ` [Download Python](https://www.python.org/)
### 2. Install pygame library
a. For Mac: `python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user` <br />
b. To test if it works: `python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens`<br />
c. For Windows `py -m pip install -U pygame --user` <br />
d. To test if it works: `py -m pygame.examples.aliens`<br />
